description: Built in go, Flurry was my solution to an API gateway. For a simple application that needed microservices proxied out to different serverless urls, there are not many simple proxies that are easily composable. Flurry is a web proxy designed for easy configuration and plugins for authentication and logging out of the box. New plugins coming soon.

<TextBlock text="Looking at the marketpalace of proxies and gateways projects like kong and nginx are interesting but were too much effort and I wanted some plugins like firebase authentication for the project I was working on. Flurry is not an ideal solution for most use cases but it worked for mine. You can check out the source code here:" />
