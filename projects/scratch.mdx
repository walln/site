description: Machine learning architectures and methods implemented from scratch.
---

<TextBlock text="This is a collection of ML models and methods implemented from scratch for my learning and reference. These are simple implementations that are not optimized for speed or memory. They are meant to be easy to read and understand. I have followed a sci-kit-learn-like API where possible. This is merely an experiment and a toy. I do not claim any copyright or encourage monetizing works created by these models." />

<TextBlock text="The source code is available on Github" />

<Link label="Source" href="https://github.com/walln/scratch" />

<TextBlock text="I am always adding new models and methods as I find notable papers or need to implement them myself to fully grok the implementation details." />
