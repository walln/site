description: ML Architectures and Methods implemented from Scratch
---

<TextBlock
  text="This is a collection of ML models and methods implemented from scratch for my own learning and reference. These are simple
  implementations that are not optimized for speed or memory. They are meant to be easy to read and understand. I have tried to follow
  a scikit-learn like API where possible."

<TextBlock text="The source code is available on Github" />

<Link label="Source" href="https://github.com/walln/scratch" />

<TextBlock text="I am always adding new models and methods as I find papers that are notable or that I cannot fully grok without implementing them myself." />
