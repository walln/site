description: Learning to mimic popular musicians with generative text models
---

<TextBlock
  text="When a popular artist has someone write songs for them it is referred to as 'ghostwriting'. 
This practice indicates that there is a pattern and style that is consistent enough to be replicated through the work of a single
artist. A friend's joke about Drake's alleged ghostwriting inspired me to try to do the same with language modeling. This repo contains
the code for a few different models that I have trained to mimic the style of popular musicians as well as the code to scrape the lyrics
to generate a dataset for training the models."
