This website is built using Next.js Tailwindcss Contentlayer and framer motion. I have really come to like the emerging web development ecosystem due to the emphasis on quality tooling and performance. In addition, this fantastic stack helps me stay up to date with web dev since I mostly do only ML stuff these days.

It is definitely overkill to use this rather than a static site builder, but these are some fun toys :)
