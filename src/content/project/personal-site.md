## My Personal Site

This is my personal website that I have iterated on over the last few years. I have really come to like the emerging web development ecosystem due to the emphasis on quality tooling and performance. In addition, this fantastic stack helps me stay up to date with web dev since I mostly do only ML stuff these days.

It is definitely overkill to use a web framework for such a simple website, but web dev actually is pretty fun compared to what I remember from when I was first learning frontend development.
