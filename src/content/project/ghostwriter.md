When a famous artist has someone write songs for them, it is referred to as *ghostwriting*. This practice indicates that there is a pattern and style that is consistent enough to be replicated through the work of a single artist. A friend's joke about Drake's alleged ghostwriting inspired me to try to do the same with LLMs. This repo contains the code for a few different models that I have implemented to mimic the style of famous musicians and the code to scrape the lyrics to generate a dataset for training the models. More than anything, this is an exercise to implement some language models and experiments with emerging techniques in generative AI.

[The source code is available on Github](https://github.com/walln/ghostwriter)

Currently this repo only includes a custom trained (severly under-trained) GPT-2 model but I am working on fine-tunes of more modern LLMs trained by teams with more resources than me.

This is merely an experiment and a toy. I do not claim any copyright or encourage monetizing works created by these models.
