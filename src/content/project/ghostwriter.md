When a famous artist has someone write songs for them, it is referred to as 'ghostwriting.' 
This practice indicates that there is a pattern and style that is consistent enough to be replicated through the work of a single
artist. A friend's joke about Drake's alleged ghostwriting inspired me to try to do the same with language modeling. This repo contains
the code for a few different models that I have implemented to mimic the style of famous musicians and the code to scrape the lyrics
to generate a dataset for training the models. More than anything, this is an exercise to implement some language models and experiments with emerging techniques in generative NLP.

This is merely an experiment and a toy. I do not claim any copyright or encourage monetizing works created by these models.
