## About Scratch

This is a collection of ML models and methods implemented from scratch for my learning and reference. These are simple implementations that are not optimized for speed or memory. They are meant to be easy to read and understand. I have followed a sci-kit-learn-like API where possible. This is merely an experiment and a toy. I do not claim any copyright or encourage monetizing works created by these models.

[The source code is available on Github.](https://github.com/walln/scratch)

I am always adding new models and methods as I find notable papers or need to implement them myself to fully grok the implementation details.
