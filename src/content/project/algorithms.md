## About Algorithms

This library contains data structures and algorithms I often end up reimplementing in python.

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/walln/algorithms)

While not the most feature-rich, this repo prevents me from rebuilding the same things repeatedly. Because there are surprisingly few settled on data structures and algorithms in the standard or popular libraries.

### Current Features

- Binary Tree
- Hash Table
- Linked List 
- Queue
- Stack
- Trie

### Roadmap

- B-Tree
- LSM Tree
- Graph (Directed, Undirected, DAG etc.)
- Traversal Algorithms
- Bit manipulation operations
- Disjoint set
- Simulated Annealing
- Binary Search
